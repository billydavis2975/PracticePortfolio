    <p>In 2021, my mom passed away at the age of 54 after a long battle with cancer. I decided then that I wanted to make the most of my life before time inevitably ran out on me too. I turned my focus on to computer programming, and I've been working to actualize my goal of becoming a computer developer ever since.</p>
